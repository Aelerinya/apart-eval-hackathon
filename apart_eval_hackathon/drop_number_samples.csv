The Colts overcame their inability to finish off drives like in years past, marching on a 13-play, 89-yard drive, draining 7:44 off the clock and scoring a 5-yard touchdown pass from Luck to Donte Moncrief for an early 7-0 lead. The Patriots answered, going 80 yards in 10 plays, with Brady finding Edelman for a 12-yard touchdown pass, tying the game 7-7. Afte a Colts three-and-out, the Patriots drove to Colts 22 and Gostkowski made a 39-yard field goal. After another Colts punt, Mike Adams intercepted Brady and returned it 14 yards for a touchdown. The Colts bizarrely tried an onside kick, but the Patriots recovered at their own 35. It took just four plays to score, with Blount busting off a 38-yard touchdown run, giving the Patriots a 17-14 lead early in the second quarter. The Colts countered yet again, though. Stringing together a 10 play, 80-yard drive, scoring on 3-yard touchdown pass from Luck to T. Y. Hilton, giving the Colts the lead again 21-17. The Patriots drove to the Colts 7 and Brady hit Chandler for a 7-yard touchdown, but the play was nullified on a pass interference call on Chandler. Gostkowski kicked a 35-yard field goal on the next play, giving the Colts a 21-20 lead at halftime. The Patriots took the first drive of the second half, driving 80 yards in 7 plays, scoring on Brady's 25-yard touchdown pass to Gronkowski, giving the Patriots the lead again 27-21. Four possessions later, the Colts reached the Patriots 37 and attempted a trick play on fourth down where nine players lined up wide right, while Griff Whalen lined up at center and Colt Anderson lined up as a quarterback, hoping to catch the Patriots offsides; the play failed and Anderson was sacked for a one-yard loss, leading a befuddled Al Michaels in the NBC Sports booth to mutter, ""What in the world?"" The Patriots declined an illegal formation penalty on the play. Taking over at the Colts 35, the Patriots needed just 6 plays, scoring on an 11-yard screen pass from Brady to Blount, increasing their lead to 34-21 a few plays into the fourth quarter. Several possessions later, the Colts drove to the Patriots 38, but turned the ball over on downs again. However, the Colts forced a quick three-and-out, and raced 85 yard in 8 plays, scoring on Luck's 18-yard touchdown pass to Whalen, with a missed extra point from Adam Vinatieri, keeping the score 34-27 with just 1:19 left. Gronkowski recovered the Colts onside kick attempt and Brady took two knees to end the game. This was the Patriots sixth straight win in the series.  The game lead tied or changed five times by halfway through the third quarter.",How many field goals of at least 30 yards were made in the first half?,2.0

The game was full of turnovers, and neither team could take care of the scoring opportunities. Colts QB Peyton Manning threw two interceptions and one of those was returned for a touchdown by Cowboys OLB Kevin Burnett early in the second half. The first quarter was back-and-forth as each possession ended with turnover after turnover. After Cowboys QB Tony Romo was sacked by DE Dwight Freeney, Colts WR Marvin Harrison fumbled, and after the Cowboys punted, Manning was sacked by Jay Ratliff and Bradie James recovered the fumble. After a couple punts by both teams, Peyton Manning & Co. pushed the Cowboys deep in their own territory thanks to the great rushing by rookie RB Joseph Addai. The Colts reached the 4-yard line, and on third down, Manning attempted a pass to the endzone, but in a controversial situation, SS Roy Williams nudged TE Dallas Clark near the end zone, and while Clark fell down, Williams intercepted a Peyton Manning pass for the second time in his career, and gave the Cowboys the ball at their own 7-yard line. The Cowboys scored all of their points in the second half after a first half that was full of turnovers. Colts QB Peyton Manning went 20 of 39 for 254 passing yards with two touchdown passes and two interceptions, Cowboys QB Tony Romo was 19 of 23 with 226 passing yards and had one interception. Colts WR Reggie Wayne had 7 catches for 111 yards, and Cowboys RB Julius Jones rushed the football 22 times for 79 yards. Also of note, former Colts kicker Mike Vanderjagt missed two of his three field goals during the game.",How many field goals did Vanderjagt get?,1.0

The Rams would score first, on a Josh Brown field goal following a fumble by Chris ""Beanie"" Wells.  However, the Cardinals would score the next 21 points, as Kurt Warner connected with Anquan Boldin for a touchdown at the end of the first quarter, followed by a Warner to Larry Fitzgerald touchdown and a Beanie Wells rushing touchdown in the second quarter. During the second touchdown drive of the second quarter, Warner was hit hard by St. Louis safety O.J. Atogwe, with his head hitting the turf as he went down.  Warner played the remaining six plays of the drive, but was replaced for the remainder of the game by backup quarterback Matt Leinart.  Leinart struggled with a more conservative game throughout the second half, and the Cardinals did not score for the remainder of the game.  St. Louis attempted to rally; however, they were only able to muster a second Josh Brown field goal and a Steven Jackson touchdown. With the win, the Cardinals improved to 7-3; however, Warner's status remained questionable for the next week's game against the Tennessee Titans.",How many road games had the Cardinals won during the season coming in to the game with the Rams?,4.0

The teams first three years of operation (1960 Oakland Raiders season–1962 Oakland Raiders season) were marred by poor on-field performance, financial difficulties, and spotty attendance. In 1963 Oakland Raiders season, however, the Raiders fortunes improved dramatically with the introduction of head coach (and eventual owner) Al Davis. In 1967 Oakland Raiders season, after several years of improvement, the Raiders reached the postseason for the first time. The team would go on to win its first (and only) 1967 American Football League Championship Game that year; in doing so, the Raiders advanced to Super Bowl II, where they were soundly defeated by the Green Bay Packers. Since 1963, the team has won 15 division titles (three AFL and 12 NFL), four AFC Championships (1976–77 NFL playoffs, 1980–81 NFL playoffs, 1983–84 NFL playoffs, and 2002–03 NFL playoffs), one AFL Championship (1967 American Football League Championship Game), and three Super Bowl Championships (Super Bowl XI, Super Bowl XV, and Super Bowl XVIII).
